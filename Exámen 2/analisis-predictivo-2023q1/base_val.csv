A quick description of myself; family and friends (in that order) are two key aspects of my life I hold dear. For that reason I love spending time with them, especially accompanied with nice food and good wine. Aside from traveling, I love to sport (running and football mostly) and enjoy my work as a real estate developer.

Welcome to a short introduction of myself. I am born and raised in Amsterdam and although living abroad for some years always found my way back. 
I am a passionate amateur chef, adventurer and philosopher. 

 I love to travel myself as well and prefer to book through airbnb compared to hotels. It really is much more comfortable to stay in an apartment and I personally also feel more connected to the city I am visiting. I welcome all the responsible guests who have an interest in my condo and assure all future hosts that I will treat their apartment with the utmost regard.

My name is Ronel, I am 26 years old and live in my New Studio in Amsterdam. The place was build ( finish ) in July 2015 and is in the most ""cosy"" part of Amsterdam ( West side ).

The West side of Amsterdam is known for a really young and hip area of the city, it is inside the highway ring ( binnen de ring ) as we Dutch call it.

I have a Girlfriend, but we don't live together. When I am not available she will be your contact if there is something wrong. 

Like you I like to travel around the world and Europe, I dive in countries where it is warm because the Dutch really don't like the cold. Good food and good wine addit to my travel and I am a happy person.

When you come to Amsterdam and book a stay in my appartment, you wil find the ""Card for success"" in the Keuken ( keuken is kitchen ). Don't worry, all good tips about nice restaurants and Nightlife are on this, just like some safety procedures you will need to read.

If you book my appartment I will make shure you will feel home in the city, so lets hope we will see you in Amsterdam.

Enjoying a city like Amsterdam is all about having a place where you feel comfortable and safe at home in a strange environment. And especially to have a good bed, a warm shower and a nice cup of coffee or tea with a stroopwafel at any time you like. In my travels I visit and visited a lot of B&B's globally. Staying in a room in somebody’s home often felt I was staying with friends. Some of them became and still are dear friends after many years. This experience is what I try to offer my guests. Live like a local, feel at home. Tot ziens in Amsterdam, Marcel.
